    "This report summarizes the benchmark analysis of VectorTree \n" +
    "by comparing its performance with:\n" +
    "  1. std::vector\n" +
    "  2. a simple persistent vector\n\n" +
    "VectorTree is created to obtain a persistent version of std::vector for multithreaded usage. " +
    "In other words, the target of VectorTree is to achieve the performance of std::vector " +
    "while keeping the persistency to deal with the concurrency issues. " +
    "Hence, the 1st container to compare with is std::vector. " +
    "The 2nd one is a very simple definition for a persistent vector. " +
    "The flowchart of any operation on the simple persistent vector is as follows:\n" +
    "  1. create a copy of the original vector,\n" +
    "  2. apply the request on the copy,\n" +
    "  3. return the modified copy."
)
descriptions.append(
    "Four fundamental operations are inspected in this benchmark:\n" +
    "  1. emplace_back\n" +
    "  2. pop_back\n" +
    "  3. pop_front\n" +
    "  4. traversal\n\n" +
    "The 3rd operation is actually not a property of the vector data structure " +
    "such that std::vector interface does not include it. " +
    "It requires one-step move operation on all elements which is linear, O(N). " +
    "Its the same, even more problematic, in case of a tree of vectors. " +
    "VectorTree solves this problem using swap-and-pop idiom " +
    "while loosing the order of elements. " +
    "Hence, the pop_front graphs showing a better performance for VectorTree, " +
    "actually shows the performance support coming from the swap-and-pop idiom. " +
    "In other words, consider the graphs for the pop_front operation as the comparison between:\n" +
    "  - pop_front: move<T> with O(N)\n" +
    "  - swap-and-pop: front() = back(); pop_back(): copy<T> with O(2*BufferSize)"
)
descriptions.append(
    "Summary of the test parameters:\n" +
    "  1. Inspected operations: emplace_back, pop_back, pop_front and traversal\n" +
    "  2. Inspected objects: Two types are inspected: type_small and type_large\n" +
    "  3. Original container size:\n" +
    "       BUFFER_SIZE_1 (32)\n" +
    "       BUFFER_SIZE_2 (1024)\n" +
    "       BUFFER_SIZE_3 (32768)\n\n" +
    "The two object types are defined simply as follows:\n" +
    "  1. type_small: an object with one field of int\n" +
    "  2. type_large: an object with an array of 256 elements of int\n\n" +
    "The number of the combinations of the test parameters are:\n" +
    "  1. # of the inspected operations: 4\n" +
    "  2. # of the inspected objects: 2\n" +
    "  3. # of the inspected original container sizes: 3\n" +
    "Hence, the combination of the test parameters yield:\n" +
    "  Test count = 4 * 2 * 3 = 24\n\n" +
    "Note that the tests are performed with a VectorTree of buffer size of 32."
)
descriptions.append(
    "The tests follow a simple algorithm:\n" +
    "  1. Initialize a container with a predefined size, N\n" +
    "  2. Aplly the operation iteratively N times on this original container\n" +
    "  3. Measure timing\n\n"
    "A templated wrapper class is created to simulate a uniform interface " +
    "for the inspected four operations " +
    "which helps to simplify the google benchmark macros. " +
    "A base template (VectorTree) and two specializations (std::vector and persistent_vector) " +
    "simulate the three containers to be compared.\n\n" +
    "DEFINE_BENCHMARK macro defines a shortcut to the google benchmark macros."
)
descriptions.append(
    "The tests are quite simple and the corresponding graphs are self-explanatory. " +
    "Hence, i will not go through the results in detail.\n" +
    "In summary:\n" +
    "  - For containers of small size, although VectorTree is the worst one,\n" +
    "    it performs efficiently (~600ms):\n" +
    "      -> See graphs with BUFFER_SIZE_1\n" +
    "  - For containers of large size, VectorTree performs way better than\n" +
    "    the simple persistent vector:\n" +
    "      -> See graphs with BUFFER_SIZE_3\n" +
    "  - VectorTree approaches to std::vector\n" +
    "    in case of the three fundamental operations:\n" +
    "      -> See graphs with BUFFER_SIZE_3 and especially with type_large\n" +
    "  - The swap-and-pop idiom provides\n" +
    "    an efficient solution to the pop_front operation:\n" +
    "      -> See graphs with pop_front"
)
descriptions.append(
    "  - The most important problem of VectorTree is the traversal performance.\n" +
    "    A traversal with a VectorTree of size=32768 takes around ~0.01 seconds\n" +
    "    which may be unacceptable in some cases:\n" +
    "      -> See Figures 21 and 24\n\n" +
    "    The iterator must step to the next leaf node\n" +
    "    when the end of the current leaf node buffer is reached\n" +
    "    which requires a DFS algorithm within the tree structure.\n" +
    "    The worst traversal performance is a result of the DFS algorithm\n" +
    "    abstracted/hidden by the path_to_leaf_node__current variable.\n" +
    "    Hence, the iterator of VectorTree must be improved.\n" +
    "    I will study two approaches to either remove or improve the DFS:\n" +
    "      1. Memoization (removes DFS):\n" +
    "         VectorTree stores a linear container of pointers\n" +
    "         to the leaf node buffers,\n" +
    "      2. Asynchronous approach (improves DFS):\n" +
    "         A thread determines the next leaf node buffer asynchronously.\n" +
    "    Both have pros and cons which must be studied in detail.\n" +
    "    For example the memoization adds more memory load:\n" +
    "      array of pointers of N/32 size where 32 is the buffer size.\n" +
    "    Asynhcronous approach, on the other hand,\n" +
    "    terminates the default copy capability of the iterator\n" +
    "    which reduces the copy construction performance.\n" +
    "    The increment operator (i.e. operator++(int)) and the derivatives\n" +
    "    becomes ineffective as a result."
